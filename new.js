// Declaring Variables and Constants


//Declaring Variables. There are 3 wats to declare variables in JS and doing an alert.

/*
//Doing an alert
alert("Welcome to learning JS with Saab!");

//Standard JS
var drink = "apple juice";
console.log(drink);

//ES6 is not supported in some older browsers
let myFood = "pasta";
console.log(myFood);

//Using const to declare a variable means it can't be reassigned
const myStreet = "Grand";
console.log(myStreet);

//Math can even be done
let number = 3 * 6;
console.log(number);

var subtraction = 46 - 8;
console.log(subtraction);

const add = 76 + 14;
console.log(add);

//Using string concatenation in js
console.log("I love drinking " + drink + " with my " + myFood + " on " + myStreet + ".");

//This is a more modern way of doing concatenation using ES6.
let restaurant = "Burger King";
console.log(`I could use a combo meal right now from ${restaurant}!`);

let name = "Chuck Wagner";

const age = 46;

var profession = "web developer";

console.log(`${name} the ${profession} just turned ${age}.`);
*/



//Assignment: Use concatenation 5 times with each three ways to right variables
let name = "Boba Fett";
let series = "Star Wars";
console.log(`${name} from ${series} is a bad dude!`);

let person = "Han Solo";
let career = "bounty hunter";
console.log(`The ${career} ${name} is always hunting ${person}.`);

let number = 12 - 6;
let food = "eggs";
console.log(`If I have a half dozen ${food}, then I have only ${number} left.`);

let woman = "Gayle";
let weight = 20;
console.log(`${woman} is ${weight} pounds overweight.`);

console.log(`${woman} is a huge ${series} fan!`);
